# freebeam
Freebeam pattern conversion software for the 
Raith EBPG e-beam lithography system, source code
distribution for RHEL or Ubuntu.

Starting from a CAD file in GDS format, Freebeam
produces fractured polygons or trapezoids in gpf format.
Polygons work on the newer UPG pattern generators. 
Trapezoids are for the older GPG systems.

The installation script works on RHEL systems, including
EBPG consoles. Instructions are included for manual  
installation on Ubuntu linux.
