# freebeam
Freebeam pattern conversion software for the 
Raith EBPG e-beam lithography system.

Starting from a CAD file in GDS format, Freebeam
produces fractured polygons in gpf format. Polygons
work only on the newer UPG pattern generators, not
on the older GPG pattern generators.

The installation script works on an EBPG console
linux computer running Red Hat EL7 or EL8. Freebeam
can be installed on other computers, but the 
instructions are not quite there yet.
