# freebeam
Freebeam pattern conversion software for the 
Raith EBPG e-beam lithography system.

Starting from a CAD file in GDS format, Freebeam
produces fractured polygons or trapezoids in gpf format.
Polygons work on the newer UPG pattern generators. 
Trapezoids are for the older GPG systems.

The installation script works on an EBPG console
linux computer running Red Hat EL7 or EL8. Manual 
instructions are included for Ubuntu Linux.
